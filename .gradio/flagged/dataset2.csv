ml,1,"1. Minimax deviation strategies for machine learning and recognition with
  short learning samples (score: 0.406)
Abstract:   The article is devoted to the problem of small learning samples in machine
learning. The flaws of maximum likelihood learning and minimax learning are
looked into and the concept of minimax deviation learning is introduced that is
free of those flaws.

2. Sample size determination for machine learning in medical research (score: 0.389)
Abstract:   Machine learning (ML) methods are being increasingly used across various
domains of medicine research. However, despite advancements in the use of ML in
medicine, clear and definitive guidelines for determining sample sizes in
medical ML research are lacking. This article proposes a method for det...

3. Machine learning's own Industrial Revolution (score: 0.388)
Abstract:   Machine learning is expected to enable the next Industrial Revolution.
However, lacking standardized and automated assembly networks, ML faces
significant challenges to meet ever-growing enterprise demands and empower
broad industries. In the Perspective, we argue that ML needs to first complete
i...

4. The Impact of Machine Learning on Society: An Analysis of Current Trends
  and Future Implications (score: 0.379)
Abstract:   The Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly evolving field of technology that has
the potential to greatly impact society in a variety of ways. However, there
are also concerns about the potential negative effects of ML on society, such
as job displacement and privacy issues. This research aimed to con...

5. Machine learning of the well known things (score: 0.379)
Abstract:   Machine learning (ML) in its current form implies that an answer to any
problem can be well approximated by a function of a very peculiar form: a
specially adjusted iteration of Heavyside theta-functions. It is natural to ask
if the answers to the questions, which we already know, can be naturally...
