This project allows you to semantically search through a large collection of research papers (mainly ML/AI) and retrieve relevant abstracts using embeddings and Pinecone. The interface is powered by Gradio for an interactive chatbot-like experience.

## Features

- Query your database of research papers using natural language.
- Retrieve top relevant papers based on semantic similarity.
- Minimal setup and easy to run locally.
- Uses `SentenceTransformer` embeddings and Pinecone for vector search.
